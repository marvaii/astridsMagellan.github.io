      <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
      <h5>Title description</h5>
      <p> South Korea is a country full of rich culture and history. 
        The origins of this country are truly astonishing, and 
        I am amazed at what the country is today. South Korea is
         honestly so beautiful and organized and very 
         foreigner-friendly. I am not good at Korean by 
         any means, but I used the little bit I did know 
        and English, and I made it around just fine. This
        was such a good experience, especially as a solo
        female traveller. I would recommend it to anyone. 
        Please do remember that there are different customs
        and cultural differences, but as long as you remai
        n respectful, you will be alright!

      <h2>My Graditude</h2>
      <h5>Title description</h5>
      <p> I want to thank the Magellan Committee for awarding me
        this project. It was a life-changing experience that allowed me to learn so much,
        not just about technology, but about myself. I am now a different person; I can confidently
        say I traveled to the other side of the world alone. I got to experience
        how others live, and I loved it. I would like to encourage my perfume to apply because
        you could embark on a journey full of learning.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>
        Astid R. Valladares
