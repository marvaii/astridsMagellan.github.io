      <h2>Breif History of the Imjin War</h2>
      <h5>This was a war fought by Korea and China against Japan</h5>
      <p> General Toyotomi Hideyoshi is credited with starting the Imjin 
        War. He declared war on Korea after he had spent two 
        decades directing campaigns to unite Japan (in Hawaii).
         After he unified his own land, he set his sights 
         on China. To gain control of China, General Hideyoshi 
         went after Korea because it was on the mainland and 
         neighbored China. General Hideyoshi first sought to 
         amend relations with Korea after a strained relationship
          caused by uncontrolled pirate attacks. He sought 
          permission from Korea for passage into China (Museum). 
          At this point in history, Korea was a vassal state 
          of China and therefore refused to aid the Japanese. 
          (Hawaii). However, King Seonjo of Korea sent envoys
           to gather information on Japanese plans going forward.
            Due to unclear reports, the King chose not to send 
            reinforcements to the Korean Peninsula, leaving 
            the people on the coast vulnerable. </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Calculated Attacks of the Imjin War</h2>
      <h5>The Japanese attacked Korea on two different occasions</h5>
      <p> The Japanese attacked Busan on April 13th, 1592, with 
        approximately 16,000 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese 
        prevailed with little difficulty, starting a seven-year 
        conflict between them, Korea, and China. In just 15 
        days of war, the Joseon capital was conquered, but King
         Seonjo was able to flee to Uiju in northwestern Korea. 
         The invasion by the Japanese left Korean farmers no 
         choice but to create their own militias that went up
          against the Japanese (Hawaii). With the help of the 
          hundreds of militias, the Korean military was able 
          to counter the Japanese by intercepting a Japanese 
          naval ship with supplies. The Korean naval forces 
          were very skilled and compared to the Japanese. 
          The Japanese occupation had many more soldiers, 
          but due to having to deal with pirates for decades, 
          the Koreans had an advantage on the water. The 
          Korean Admiral Yi Sun-sin is said to be the first
           to build an ironclad ship, but there is no proof 
           because this ship was lost many decades ago. 
           As the War progressed, the Ming Dynasty sent reinforcements 
           at the request of King Sonjo because the Japanese had
            reached the border between Korea and China. 
            Together, the Chinese and Koreans were able to 
            run off the Japanese to the South of Korea and negotiate. (museum). </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Imjin War is Over</h2>
      <h5>The events that led to the war ending</h5>
      <p> When it was time to reach an agreement, 
        the real demands of Hideyoshi never reached 
        Emperor Ming. Instead, the Emperor received a 
        falsified request pleading for forgiveness and 
        requesting to become a vassal state of China. 
        (Hawaii). China agreed to these terms, 
        infuriating Hideyoshi. Thus, Hideyoshi launched his 
        second attack on Korea again in 1597 with an army
        of 140,000 soldiers. It is believed that General
        Hideyoshi was able to win this battle because 
        Admiral Yi was wrongly incarcerated.
        Even though they were victorious during 
        the naval battle, they did not succeed in
        taking more of Korea because the Chinese 
        army now backed the Korean military. 
        Despite his initial success, not long 
        after Toyotomi Hideyoshi died due to 
        illness on September 18, 1598. His 
        successor, Tokugawa Jeyasu, ordered the 
        Japanese troops to retreat from Korea 
        three months after Hideyoshi. After 
        Admiral Yi was reinstated, he was shot and
        killed at the last battle between Korea 
        and Japan. Admiral Yi was was hero to his 
        people and one of the reasons that the 
        Japanese could never gain control of Korean waters. </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Breif History on World War II</h2>
      <h5>The Influence of Japan</h5>
      <p>Shortly before WWII, the Japanese started to 
        colonize Korea again. Once again, the goal is 
        to take over China, but due to the Imjin War, 
        they had the knowledge on how to take control of
        Korea. Once World War II starts, Japan is Allied
        with Russia and Germany. Later in the war, Japan
        attacked Pearl Harbor, prompting the United 
        States to declare war on Japan. After the 
        Japanese surrender and the war was over, 
        Korea was divided at the 38th parallel, 
        with the USSR controlling North Korea and the 
        United Nations, along with the United States, 
        controlling South Korea. (KWAR).</p>

<div class="grid-item">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Korean War</h2>
      <h5>A Military Imbalance</h5>
      <p>The division was done to facilitate the surrender of Japan 
        and also in order to reunify the Koreas eventually. 
        North Korea was Communist, and South Korea was a 
        democracy. Reunification was the goal when North 
        Korea attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950, 
        in the name of communism. <br><br>The North Korean 
        leader Kim Il-sung, attacked with weapons from the 
        Soviet Union and support from Communist China and 
        wreaked havoc on South Korea (Cause). South Korea 
        was not prepared at all for this war and suffered 
        a lot of damage early on, and continued to do so 
        until the tables turned when South Korea was able 
        to take back Seoul.

      <h2>A Cease Fire</h2>
      <h5>The War is not Over</h5>
      <p>A ceasefire was able to be negotiated and brought 
        back the DMZ at the 38th parallel. Nowadays, 
        this area is considered one of the most heavily 
        guarded places in the world. The South Korean 
        people still speak very fondly of the idea of 
        reunification.<br><br>After the war ended, the United States helped 
        South Korea with reconstruction with financial aid, 
        military aid, and goods. To further help South Korea,
         teachers and professors were educated in the United 
         States. These aids allowed South Korea to better itself
          and create the advancement that has changed the lives
          of millions today. At present, the United States
        Military makes up a large part of the South 
        Korean Military.</p>
