      <h2>Namsam Tower</h2>
      <h5> It's not as big as expected?</h5>
      <p> Namsam Seoul tower was not directly related to the Korean or Imjin war, 
        But it was built at the highest point in Seoul. This tower is approximately 
        460 feet above sea level. This tower is actively being used to provide 48% 
        The country's broadcasting to stations such as KBS. The tower features an 
        observation deck that can be visited if a ticket is purchased. 
        Next to the tower, you can also visit the Love Lock of Seoul Tower, where couples
         go to attach a lock to the railing.<br><br>I visited this attraction 
         because it provides a panoramic view of the city. From the tower,
          you can view the Han River and part of the Seoul wall. The
          Seoul wall was built during the Joseon Dynasty to protect the city.<br><br>
          On the windows, there are indicators that tell you how far 
          away cities are from the point and direction in which you are 
          standing. </p>

      <h2>Demilitarized zone (DMZ) </h2>
      <h5> The border between the North and the South</h5>
      <p>This area can be considered the border between 
        North and South Korea. The border spans 160 miles 
        from sea to sea. The DMZ is not a physical border, 
        but it spans two kilometers from the military line of 
        demarcation.<br><br>I visited the DMZ with
        a tour group composed of 11 people. The tour group met 
        up at Hongik Station at 7 am. It was 40-50 minutes to the
        first stop, Imjinak. This is where we had to go to get 
        our tickets to enter the DMZ, but we also went around 
        with our guide, who informed us that Imjinak was created 
        for the time of reunification.<br><br>From my understanding,
         there were high hopes of reunification of the Koreas long ago, 
         and there still are because of how our guide spoke. 
         She reminded us that South Korea recently elected 
         a new president, and she stated that he is more 
         lenient with North Korea.</p>

      <h2>Changes to the DMZ</h2>
      <h5>Present vs A Couple Years Ago</h5>
      <p> According to my guide, the DMZ is not what it used to be
         years ago, because of an incident between the North and the 
         South. The area used to be more tourist-friendly in terms of 
         of what is and is not allowed. Our guide told us that the 
         repercussions stemmed from the US and South Korea wanting 
         to trim a tree, but the North did not agree. This disagreement
          escalated when U.S soldiers were trimming the tree and were 
          killed by the North Koreans. This tragic incident led to 
          both sides are separated with no contact. Although our 
          guide shared that she thinks that the tensions will start
           to ease with the new president, and the restricted areas 
           will gradually start to open, later this year.</p>

      <p> Imjinak is a resort that was built in 1972 when the North and the South 
        agreed to a ceasefire. This area is located a couple of kilometers from 
        The DMZ is surrounded by monuments and historical memorabilia.<br><br>
        Here you can find the peace bell, which was made as a goodbye to the 20th century. 
        You can pay to ring it.<br><br>The “Old Steam Locomotive.” 
        This was a train used by South Korea and the United States to 
        transport supplies during the Korean War. It looks like this
        because it was captured by North Korea during a shipment, 
        and instead of surrendering the weapons and supplies
        on board the North, they decided to destroy the 
        merchandise themselves.<br><br>The Mangbaran Altar was created
        for the North Korean defectors who could not travel to their
        hometowns and pay their respects to their ancestors during

      <h2> Background on the Unification Bridge the DMZ</h2>
      <h5>A Story Told to us by the Guide</h5>
      <p>To get to the DMZ, you must cross the Unification Bridge,
         which has a very heartbreaking origin. The unification bridge 
         was funded by the CEO and founder of Hyundai, who was originally
        from North Korea. Chung Ju-yung left the North when he was young
        because his family was extremely poor, and he wanted to take
        them out of poverty. Unfortunately, when he made his millions,
        he could not freely travel back and support his family. When the
        bridge opened, he took 1,001 cows with him in a parade for 
        this daily and the North Korean government. This was done
        because to leave the North, he stole one of his father's cows
        and used the earnings to go to Seoul. Although he was allowed
        to enter and see his family for a bit, the moment was fleeting
        because he could not stay for long.

      <h2>Entering the DMZ</h2>
      <h5>Crossing the Unification Bridge</h5>
      <p> </p>Before entering the DMZ, we were asked to sign our names on a 
      sheet so that the soldiers who boarded our bus could find us more 
      easily when looking at our passports. The soldier looked at 
      everyone's identification and counted the number of people 
      on the bus twice. This process happened for every vehicle that entered the DMZ, but I found it to be efficient. 
    </div> 
    <div class="grid-item">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Third Infiltration</h2>
      <h5>Our Second Offical Site</h5>
      <p>Once inside the DMZ, we headed to the 3rd infiltration tunnel. This 
        is one of four known tunnels that North Korea dug by hand to reach 
        the South. Unfortunately, there were no pictures allowed in the tunnel.<br><br>To get to the tunnel, 
        there was an incline of 13 degrees that was 100 meters (about 328.08 ft)
        long. It was very cold and wet because it was below ground. 
        Most people had to crouch because the tunnel was not tall in stature.
        I did not have this issue, but if you are over five feet tall, it 
        might be uncomfortable for you.<br><br>The tunnel is not very wide, so 
        there is some traffic along the way. Once we reached the end of the tunnel,
        there were cameras that showed us past the barrier that protected us. 
        There was also a small window that you could look through that displayed 
        real plants that were growing beyond the barrier. At that point,
        we were 170 meters (about 557.74 ft) from North Korea.

      <h2>New Obseratory</h2>
      <h5>The Third Offical Site</h5>
      <p>After the tunnel, we headed toward the observatory where we could freely
         look at North Korea. This was the new observatory that was built because
          North Korea destroyed the first one. Sadly, we could not take pictures 
          of North Korea because if apprehended, the military personnel could 
          delete the picture along with any others they pleased from your phone. 
          This is also where "propaganda" is played for North Korea through very 
          loudspeakers. They play music and the news for them.</p>

      <h2>"Propaganda Village"</h2>
      <h5>The Last Offcial Cite</h5>
      <p>When the Koreas came to their agreement for a “truce,” they decided 
        that there would be two villages for each country. We went down to the
        Southern one, which has about 200 inhabitants and cannot be inhabited 
        by just anyone. This village has a curfew, and only about 12 kids 
        attend the international school there. Contrary to the South village,
        the North village is not inhabited but is made to look as though 
        it is inhabited. The Northern village has fake people and homes 
        with blacked-out windows; you cannot see that from the observatory. </p>

        <img src = "image/IMG_1730.jpg"  width="500" height="600"> 
      <p>HiKR Ground is a tourist attraction that focuses on immersive 
        digital displays. The name HiKR is derived from the idea that Korea (KR) 
        welcomes all tourists (Hi). The building is made up of five floors, 
        but the first and last are information centers. This experience is 
        completely free and starts on the second floor. The first attraction
         features “various media arts” that make good photo opportunities. 
         The second floor gears more towards the K-pop phenomenon. This floor 
         featured interactive displays. The third floor featured various 
         perfumes, and the opportunity to design your known cap. 
         From looking at their Instagram, the third floor 
         changes activities often.<br><br>The second floor adhered most to the
        theme of my Magellan. There were various digital
         activities you could interact with. This was achieved with a 
         screen and a “spray paint can” that was calibrated to the screen. 
         The next floor was geared more towards how technology is used 
         in modern times. There was a karaoke set up and a streamer set
          up that were open to all.<br><br>When I first arrived, it was basically
           empty, then a few people trickled in, but it was not crowded at all. 
           Overall, I would recommend this experience because it is free, 
           and when I went there was a booth giving out free things if you
            posted them on your social media. I got a free portable
             charger, fan, and reusable tote.

      <p>While I was in Seoul, I found most places to be accessible 
        and quite easy to navigate to especially because I stayed 
        near Seoul Station. Most places were within 20-30 minutes 
        by metro; for some places, you had to walk, but it was never 
        long distances. Before I got to Seoul, I did not know what to 
        expect at all. I thought it would be different. It was more 
        advanced and orderly.<br><br>Myeongdong 
        was only a couple of stops away from Seoul Station, and there were
        a variety of things to do. I recommend visiting Myeong-dong market
        for some tasty food. This was one of my favorite places because it 
        was very modern-looking and had very pretty architecture. I especially
        loved the station itself because the outside looked round and very 
        reflective, as shown in the picture. I recommend going to Mimi line 
        and Nyu Nyu for souvenirs.  Gangnam had the most skyscrapers. 
        This is because this is where many people work. 
        I found Gangnam to be calm. Although when I was there 
        was an event for kids that promoted reading. Although it was not 
        so different from other cities. I think when people speak of 
        technological advancements,they mean the convenience that 
        you are exposed to.

      <h2>Libray Observation</h2>
      <h5>Starfeild Library vs Seoul Metropolitan Library</h5>
       <img src = "image/IMG_2123.jpg" width="500" height="600"> 
         <img src = "image/IMG_2797.jpg"   width="500" height="600"> 
      <img src = "image/IMG_2127.jpg"  width="500" height="600"> 
      <p> I visited two Starfield libraries. One was in Suwon and the 
        other in Gangnam. I was surprised that the library was in the 
        COEX mall. The library was three floors high but did not take 
        up the whole floor. Each section was most comparable in size 
        to a larger store. This library was not like a typical library
        and seemed to be more of a tourist attraction. It was 
        a functioning library that held a variety of books. Although 
        I found out that only the first couple of shelves near the
        ground had real books, and the higher shelves that reached 
        the ceiling only held spines.<br><br>I really enjoyed the design 
        of the mall; it was very modern, and I understand why it was an 
        attraction. Personally, I could not imagine trying to do any work
        there. Even though throughout the library there were places where
        you could sit and work, I think that because of the location (mall),
        it was very loud.<br><br> In terms of technological advancement,
        it was more modern than other libraries. 
        I think this can only be said about the architecture, 
        though, because I do not think the book-checking process 
        is any different. I did note that there was a station 
        where you could use iPads. Overall, I do not recommend 
        it for focusing and doing work, but to visit and take
        pictures it is gorgeous, and you should visit.<br><br>I visited the 
        Seoul Metropolitan Library for my comparison. This building was
        much bigger and did its job of creating an environment meant
        for working and productivity. I really enjoyed the one section;
        it sort of resembled the Starfield library in this regard. 
        Both libraries use stairs as seating.<br><br>While I was in Korea,
        I met an architect, and I asked her if stairs worked in the 
        Starfield library, and she said, “Stairs will always add to a room.” 
        I live by this now. </p>

      <p>I enjoyed the cafe culture in Seoul. I was not actively seeking 
        out new and interesting places to visit, but I did make it a
        point to visit the ones within walking distance of my lodging. 
        I was impressed by the number of cafes there were and how late 
        they stayed open. This was because most cafes did not open till noon.
        <br><br>I cannot focus in my room or dorm to do any type of work, 
        so I enjoyed being able to go to cafes to do my Magellan. 
        I never found them distracting and found it quite easy to 
        lock in and do my work. I highly recommend visiting cafes
        in Seoul, especially the themed ones.

        This area was once a highway that has been converted into a park. 
        It is quite long, featuring thousands of plants, each is displayed 
        with both its scientific name and Korean name.<br><br>I found this to 
        be such a wonderful way to add greenery to such an urbanized city. 
        This structure allows many people to get their daily steps and
         human interaction. Along this path, you can find a piano,
        trampolines, and cafes with seating areas. 
        I would frequently take this route when I had to take a 
        bus instead of a metro. To get to the bus station, 
        I would have to get to one of the staircases or elevators 
        that were marked by numbers. I loved this walkway and would 
        frequently walk it even if it were not on my way home.</p>

         Imjin War had ended. When it was finally restored, the 
         palace gained new buildings, most notably the Okhoru Pavilion,
        where Empress Okhoru was assassinated in 1895. Since its

        When you are there are so many people because this demonstration
        only occurs twice a day at 10:00 am and at 2:00 pm. Before the

        marching as they approach the designated performance area.
        As with any military unit, there is a commander who instructs

        other focuses on the special garden. The garden
        tour is very sought after because of its 
        limited slots, so be sure to get there early!<br><br>
        You can also rent a Hanbok near this palace, 
        but there are more options near Gyeongbokgung Palace. 
        Compared to Gyeongbokgung Palace, I found this one to 
        be less crowded, allowing you to take pictures without
        others in the background.</p>

      <p> Hanbok is the name of traditional clothing, but it
         also means Korean clothing. For women, the Hanbok 
         is composed of a jacket and a skirt. The skirt 
         is like overalls because it goes over the shoulders.
        The jacket is long-sleeved and is cropped. The
        Hanbok for men is a jacket and pants, but it
        still shares the same design and style.<br><br>The 
        Hanbok dates back over 2,000 years, although most
        modern Hanboks are modeled after the Hanbok that
        existed during the Joseon Dynasty. If you have 
        ever seen a historical Korean drama, you may 
        have noticed this garb before.<br><br>I rented this dress 
        near Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung palaces. 
        There are many places to rent from, and it is 
        highly affordable. You can either book online 
        via websites such as Klook or go in person and
        ask around. The place I rented from rented the
        dress to me for three hours, and I got my hair 
        braided for free and an umbrella for free. 
        Hanbok comes in many colors but remains the same 
        style. I decided on mint green because I wanted 
        the Hanbok to match my shoes.</p>
